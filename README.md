# Traffic Sign Recognition

----

#### Project Information

* The end goal of the project is to classify different traffic signs correctly.
* The dataset used is the project is [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
* There are 43 different classes present in the dataset.

#### Basic Flow

* Before running the .ipynb file, upload the `signnames.csv` and your `kaggle.json` credential files either directly to the environment or pull it using google colab.
* Model predictions can be found in the `Prediction.ipynb` notebook or in the **example_output** directory.
* The trained model is saved in the **saved_model** directory.


##### Credits:
* This project is based on the tutoral blog written by **Dr. Adrian Rosebrok** -> [Traffic Sign Classification with Keras and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/11/04/traffic-sign-classification-with-keras-and-deep-learning/)
